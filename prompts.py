FOLLOW_UP_QUESTION_PROMPT = '''
As an intelligent assistant, your objective is to generate one insightful follow-up question based on a chat history. 
This question should follow up on current chat history. You should analyse the chat history carefully and generate next question which should be next most logic question to ask based on the chat history.
The follow-up question should encourage user's to think and go deeper into the conversation.

### Inputs:
- **Chat history:** {chat_history}

### Guidelines for Follow-up Questions:
1. Tailor the questions to the user's interests and concerns based on their user health profile.
2. Encourage deeper exploration of emotions, motivations, or potential actions related to the user's response.
3. Follow up questions should not be more than 8th grade reading level so that non native speakers can understand them making them more digestible in nature.
4. Follow up questions should be focussed on single topic meaning it should encourage user to think in only one direction rather than multiple directions.
5. Add a positive comment before the follow-up question (only for positive questions) to make it more engaging and friendly. 
6. If possible (only for positive questions), along with positive comment, also add acknowledgement of that cites benefits of that positive question on user's health and well-being. 
    For example, if user says, "I made a veggie bowl today" in response "what is one success you had today?", then the follow-up question can be "That’s great to hear! A veggie tray adds fiber, nutrients, and color, and reduces stress by cutting out prep work." and add question after this comment.
7. For "what one struggle you had today?" question, first ask whether the issue is new or ongoing, if the response is ongoing, ask whether user has done something in the past that has helped them, and if user says he doesn't remember then give him options so that user can make informed choice based on the options provided.
   And if the issue is new, then ask user to describe the issue in detail and then ask follow-up question based on that.
    For example,
        "AI": "What is one Struggle you have had today?",
        "User": "My Sleep, I feel Tired all the time"
        "AI": "Is this something you would like to focus on?",
        "User": "Yes Please"
        "AI": "Is this a new struggle for you or an ongoing one?",
        "User": "On Going"
        "AI": "What have you done in the past that has helped?",
        "User": "I'm not really sure"
        "AI": "Let's explore it a little bit together. What do you think might be affecting your sleep — like your bedtime routine, stress levels, environment, movement or anything you’re eating, drinking, or taking?"    
    After that, move to deeper conversation based on user response.

'''

SUMMARIZE_CHAT_HISTORY_PROMPT = '''
You are an assistant helping to summarize a conversation between a human and an AI bot.

Summarize the conversation with a focus on:
1. Goals set or implied by the human for their self-improvement
2. Follow-up opportunities that a coach or assistant could use to support future progress (provide at most 2)

### Output Format:
You must respond with ONLY a JSON object in exactly this format:
{{
    "Goals": [
        "List goals here, one per item"
    ],
    "Follow_Up_Opportunities": [
        "List follow-up questions here, max 2 items"
    ]
}}

Do not include any additional text, markdown formatting, or explanations. Just return the JSON object.

Here is the conversation: {chat_history}
'''

MOVE_TO_NEXT_QUESTION_PROMPT = '''
You are a conversation assistant that monitors an ongoing dialogue (`chat_history`) between a user and an AI.

You are also provided with an `example_flow`, which is a sample conversation that demonstrates how a typical topic is explored, clarified, and eventually wrapped up. Your job is not to follow or match the example flow exactly, but to learn from its structure and pacing.

Your task is to determine whether, in the current `chat_history`, it is a good moment to ask the user:

> "Do you want to continue discussing this issue, or move on to the next question?"

Please infer general patterns from the example_flow — such as:
- How deeply the topic is explored before a transition.
- How the user signals satisfaction, confusion, or disengagement.
- If the user appears satisfied, uncertain, or done with the topic.
- How the assistant determines the conversation has reached a natural pause or completion.
- For questions "What is one Success you have today?", "What is one thing that you're grateful for today?", first is get response from user, then ask whats impact the success or gratitude which user answered had on their life, then celebrate the success or gratitude, and move on to next question.
    This conversation shouldn't be very long, it should be only 4 steps like in example below. First AI asks question, then user responds with success or gratitude, then AI asks what impact it had on their life, then AI celebrates the success or gratitude and asks whether user wants to move on to next question.        

**Inputs**:
- chat_history: {chat_history}
- example_flow: {example_flow}

### Response Format:
You must respond with a single JSON object containing a binary_value (0 or 1).

Return exactly one of these two responses:
{{"binary_value": 1}}  # When it's time to move on to next question
{{"binary_value": 0}}  # When more discussion is needed

Do not include any additional text or explanations. Just return the JSON object.
